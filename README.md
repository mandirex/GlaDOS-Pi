# GlaDOS-PI
A very simple console based os for the Raspberry PI

### Goals:
* Create a working operating system (os) for use on the Raspberry Pi (a very small computer)
* Working keyboard input
* Maybe a BASIC interpreter
* A basic shell for interaction with the os
* A interpreter for our own games engine (text based)
