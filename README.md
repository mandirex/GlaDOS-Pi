# GlaDOS-PI
A very simple console based os for the Raspberry PI
We are trying to build an OS for the Raspberry PI from scratch

### Goals:
* Create a working operating system (os) for use on the Raspberry Pi (a very small computer)
* Working keyboard input
* Maybe a BASIC interpreter
* A basic shell for interaction with the os
* A interpreter for our own games engine (text based)

### Tools / Rescources: 
* QEmu - https://www.qemu.org/
* GCC ARM - https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
* make - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
